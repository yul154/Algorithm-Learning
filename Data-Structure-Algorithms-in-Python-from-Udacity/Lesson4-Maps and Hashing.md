# Set
* no order
* no repeat element
* like a big
* The key in a map is a set
* Map is a set-based structure
* A group of unique keys without order
# Hashing
* look-ups in constant time
* Hashing function:transform(based on some formula) value to hasing value(index)
*  Collisions: spit out same hash value from two different input
  1. change hash function
  2. Change structure of array(bucket): change one hash value to an array
  3. nested hash function
# Hashing Map
* Key,value structure
* set-based structure
* String Keys:
  1. covert letters to numbers(ASCII)
