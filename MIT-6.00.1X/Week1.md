# Computer job
1. Calculations: build-in, user-define
2. remembers
# Knowledge
1. declarative knowledge: statements of fact
2. imperative knowledge: a recipe or solution
   1. *sequence steps*
   2. *flow of control* process that specifies when each step is executed
   3. a means of determing when to *stop*
   
# Machines
* Machine Architecture: 
  1. Memory: store data, instructions
  2. Arithmetic Logic Unit:take information from memory, read them and then do a primitive operation
  3. Control Unit: where I am in a sequence of instructions.
    * program counter:points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program., when test, program counter will come back to first constrcution
* Basic primitives: move left, move right, scan, read , write, do nothing

# Type
* Scalar types:
1. int
2. float
3. book
4. NoneType
* return value and `print`:
  * return value will return real value
  * `print` will return nothing

# Variables
* Equal string is an *assignment* of a value to a variable name

# Operators and Branching
* Comparsion: `round()` to more close
* Logical comparsion
`5*2 == 5.0*2.0 --> True`

#String
> a sequence of characters
* Double quote are handy: sometimes want to use single apostrophe in a string
* Opreations: concatenation(+),successive concatenation(*),len(),indexing,slicing([:-1] without last one)

# Control flow:
* Branching program need a tesy: True or False
* <condtion> has a value : True or False
* `while` condition: `if` loop,need set variable outside
* `range()`:
   1. range(3): 0,1,2
   2. range(1,5,2): 1,3
   3, range(1,5,-1):5,4,3,2
   4. range(5,-1,-1):5,4,3,2,1,0
   5. range(5)[::-1]:4,3,2,1,0
   
# Iteration
* Use same code mutiple times
* While loop:
   1. set an iteration variable outside the loop
   2. Test variable to determine when done
   3. Change vairable within loop
* For loop:
