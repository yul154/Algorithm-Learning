# Python Overview
* Script(interpreted) language
* Dynameically typeed language: no declaration associating an identifier with a data type,it can later be reassigned to another object of the same (or different) type
* A list is a referential structure, as it technically stores a sequence of references to its elements
* Triple-quoted strings is that newline characters can be embedded naturally
* `set()` 
  1. based on Hash table
  2. Only instances of immutable types can be added to a Python set.
  3. `frozenset class` is an immutable form of the set type

* Operators
  1. Logical Operators:`not,and, or`
  2. Equality Operators:`is ,is not, ==, !=`
